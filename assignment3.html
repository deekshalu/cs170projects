			<h2 style="font-family:serif;"><u> A Brief History of Genentech </h2></u>
				<p> 
					Genentech was founded on
					<a href="https://www.labiotech.eu/in-depth/history-biotechnology-genentech/"> April 7th, 1976 </a>
					and became the first biotechnology company to go public. They started very humbly, having no assets or necessary equipment. Still, they were able use recombinant <i> E. coli </i> bacteria to produce the human protein somatostanin. This same process was later used by the company to produce the human horman insulin, a very huge breakthrough for the company and the world of medicine. According to a European Biotech website, previous to this research, animal versions of the insulin was harvested. The 
					<a href="https://www.genome.gov/25520305/online-education-kit-1976-first-genetic-engineering-company"> National Human Genome Research Institute </a>
					reports that the company isolated genes for human insulin and growth hormone to create the <q>first recombinant DNA drug, human insulin.</q> The company developed this drug as a solution to the problems the previous method had. When using animal pancreas to harvest the insulin hormone, one company. Eli Lily had to use <a href="https://www.gene.com/stories/cloning-insulin"> 56 million animals per year </a> to meet insulin demands. Insulin is very important for diabetics since they lack the hormone, and insuline hormone reguales the body's blood sugar levels. The process of the experiment and their research are summarized on their <a href="https://www.gene.com/stories/cloning-insulin"> website. </a>

					<a href="https://www.labiotech.eu/in-depth/history-biotechnology-genentech/"> <img src="genentech.jpeg" alt="genentech origins" style="float:right;"> </a>
				<p> 
					The development of recombinant insulin changed the face of biotechnology and pharameuticals. Many years later, Genentech is often considered the founder of the industry. In 2009, the company <a href="https://www.gene.com/about-us"> became a member of the Roche Group. </a> Based in Switzerland, <a href="https://www.roche.com/about.htm"> Roche</a> develops innovative medications and is considered to be <q>a pioneer in healthcare.</q> According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/business/worldbusiness/13drugs.html"><i>The New York Times</i></a>, prior to Genentech's acquisition, it was considered to be one of the oldest and most successful of all biotechnology companies. The merger has shown that both Roche and Genentech have closer ties than most acquisition merger do, with Roche's three big drugs having been developed by Genentech. From being one of the world's first and biggest biotech companies, Genentech has made history both in the past and in the present with is acquisition by Roche. Genentech has been ranked as one of the best companies to work at, and I beleive their important strides in the healthcare and pharmaseutical industry encourages worker dedication. This dedication allows the company to continue making important drug developments, allowing employees and patients to be satisfied all around.

					According to FORTUNE, the firm's employees gush about its work culture. Genentech 401(k) program offers a baseline 6% match with additional 4% in additional compensations. Some of the perks of being a Genentech employee are unlimited sick days, telecommuting, subsidized childcare, college tuition reinbursement, compressed workweeks, and job sharing. One perk that I thought was very important in the social justice sphere of life was a sexial orientation inclusive non-discrimination policy. For those interested in gender and ethnic diversity in the workplace, Genentech's workforce employees nearly 54% women and has about 50% diversity. The company also hires many new graduates in the near 140,000 applicants they recieve. This is all information on the FORTUNE's website and truly does show that Genentech is one of the best companies to work at.
